### Challenge: Implement a Popup Modal with Signatures and Toggles

## Approach i took to solve the challenge:

I created starting page which has button to open pop up for viewing the record,

for ``` Modal ``` i created component which can be reused in other place where modal is needed,

created a view record component, that includes all required fields, and also made separate component
for each section,
on the canvas i used ref to identify canvas element from the dom, and manipulate it using different lifecycle of the component.
and rendered it using 2d context.
